# Personal Homepage:

Welcome to my personal homepage. As the name suggests, this website was made to be a representation of me. It goes over my hobbies, interests, and my philosophy on life! The webpage was originally made to convey more information about me, however I am in the process of taking this static website and transforming it into a dynamic one. I am doing so using Django for the backend and React.js for the front end! This updated webpage will be centered around my projects and work experience while still having pages dedicated to my non-programming passions.
