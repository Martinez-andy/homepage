Bootstrap:
    On my about me page, I used Bootstrap's carousel feature. I also used their button template in the contact me page.

Javascript:
    I used javascript to do two things on the contact me page. One: make sure the user actually input text into the
    text box. Two: alert the user that "the message was sent successfully." I looked into having the send button
    actually sent an email to my input but it would require external stuff so I instead opted to have the button's
    only functionality be to display alerts.
